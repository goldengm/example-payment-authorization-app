# Transaction App Example

## Description

The transaction app is an app that creates a step verification to the checkout process allowing or rejecting an order placement. This repository provides an example on how to accomplish it.

## Usage

To get started you should edit the `manifest.json` file to properly select the app name, for this example: `paym-step-app`. You should also input the correct initial version and, if applicable, change the vendor name.  
  
Create a new workspace and link this app to your store and workspace.
